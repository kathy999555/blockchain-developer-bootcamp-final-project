Blockchain Final Project Idea:

My blockchain final project idea is to help teachers report any really bad incidents or behaviors of staff without the fear of losing their jobs. For example, if a school has a bad principal and are abusing their staff ie if sexist or are making their jobs much harder than they should be then the teachers can anonymously contact the board of directors and the date is recorded permanently of when the issue is addressed. This would allow for job security but to also address certain issues. As it would cost gas money teachers should only do it in extreme cases like if the principal is corrupt as they wouldn't normally want to speak out against them in fear of losing their job or getting in a worse position. This dapp will erase fear as only the board will be able to see these submissions.  This may also encourage higher authority figures to be kinder and more considerate to their staff so staff won't have to make these transactions. This idea is inspired by teachers being able to complete surveys that are meant to be anonymous but never are and so teachers don't give their full opinion. Also third party survey companies are not trustworthy (for example in survey monkey you have to give your email to complete the survey) and are held in suspicion by teachers. Furthermore, anonymous emails can be traced back to the sender and this idea would allow staff to even message the board at home so they have no fear of being watched when providing their real opinion. This concept can also be used in any workplace environment as well. 

I was thinking about using this for only serious matters to emphasise the impact of the issue and so the fields could be : staff name (including principal -the one the teacher wants to complain about), then a message box that they can explain the issue and then the blockchain automatically saves the date and time. Therefore as the teacher has taken the time to use the blockchain it is a very serious matter so the board knows to look into it and especially if there are multiple transactions about a specific individual.

The dapp would be on a private ethereum network for each school but only for staff and the board of directors. Every teacher and each board member would be required to set up the private thereum network and run the nodes. Furthermore, cost for gas would be picked up by the school. It wouldn't be for the principal and/or senior managers so they can't have any interference. 
1. Teachers and board of directors register on contract
2. If have problem use the private network 
3. Send message of problem to board
4. Board read annonomous message and do investigation on it
